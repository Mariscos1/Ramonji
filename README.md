Kanji Learning website
Yeah so if you think the website still looks like trash, believe me, it looked even worse
whenever I created the first README file for this repository. I think that right now this website looks
pretty legit comapared to a lot of websites on the internet, but anyways back to what the website is about.
This website is supposed to help you with learning japanese kanji while also not being too boring to look at, so
I hope that the website looks good now, and trust me when I say that I may make it better, but I'm still not so sure
right now at the moment.

UPDATE: I'm remaking this in another file in react, check out that Repository
